# T1045: Packed Binaries

For this exercise, I will pack a binary with a well known UPX packer.

## Execution

```csharp
.\upx.exe -9 -o .\nc-packed.exe .\nc.exe
```

Note how the file size shrank by 50%!

## Observations

Some of the tell-tale signs of a UPX packed binary are the PE section headers - note the differences between `nc-packed.exe` and `nc.exe`:

Another important observation should be made from the above screenshot - `nc-packed` binary's `Raw Size` \(section's size on the disk\) is 0 bytes for the UPX0 section \(.text/.code section\) and is much smaller than the `Virtual Size` \(space allocated for this section in process memory\), whereas these values in a non-packed binary are of similar sizes.  This is another good indicator suggesting the binary may be packed when it's 0 bytes on the disk, but gets expanded/unpacked in memory.

Yet another sign of a potentially packed binary is a low\(-er\) number of imported DLLs and their functions:

Note how the packed binary only imports one function from the `WSOCK32.dll` and many more are imported by a non-packed binary:

A classic sign of a packed binary is the imported functions from a `KERNEL32.dll`. The functions `LoadLibraryA` and `GetProcAddress` are crucial for the binary as they are used to locate other important functions of the `KERNEL32.dll` located in the process memory, hence packed binaries will almost always have those functions exposed:

If there are no fancy tools to hand, but you have `strings.exe`, you can make a fairly good educated guess whether the binary is packed by just running strings against it and noting the DLL imports - if there's only a few of them \(and more importantly - GetProcAddress and LoadLibrary\) and they are from KERNEL32.dll - the binary is likely packed:
